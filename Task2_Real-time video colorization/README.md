## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Live webcam colorization with minimal latency
- **Multiple Models**: Switch between PyTorch Simple and OpenCV DNN models
- **Video Upload**: Process uploaded video files with progress tracking
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS and processing time display
- **Download Results**: Save colorized videos for later use
- **User-friendly GUI**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit interface
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for various scenarios

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam (for live processing)
- Sufficient RAM (4GB+ recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you have app.py, requirements.txt, and README.md
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`
   - If not, manually navigate to the URL shown in the terminal

## üéõÔ∏è How to Use

### 1. Model Selection
- Choose between two colorization models:
  - **PyTorch Simple**: Fast, lightweight model for real-time processing
  - **OpenCV DNN**: High-quality pre-trained model for better results

### 2. Live Webcam Mode
- Click "üé• Start Webcam" to begin real-time colorization
- View original grayscale and colorized video side by side
- Monitor FPS and processing time in the sidebar
- Click "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Webcam" to stop the feed

### 3. Video Upload Mode
- Upload a video file (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV)
- Watch the processing progress in real-time
- View sample frames from the processed video
- Download the colorized video using the download button

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- **FPS**: Frames per second (higher is better)
- **Processing Time**: Time per frame in milliseconds
- **Model Info**: Description of the selected model

## üîß Technical Details

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webcam not working**
   - Ensure your webcam is connected and not in use by other applications
   - Check browser permissions for camera access
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Model loading errors**
   - Check your internet connection (models are downloaded automatically)
   - Ensure sufficient disk space for model files
   - Try restarting the application

3. **Low FPS**
   - Use the PyTorch Simple model for better performance
   - Close other applications to free up system resources
   - Consider using a GPU if available

4. **Memory errors**
   - Reduce video resolution or frame rate
   - Process shorter video clips
   - Restart the application

### Performance Tips

- **For Real-time Processing**: Use PyTorch Simple model
- **For High Quality**: Use OpenCV DNN model
- **For Large Videos**: Process in smaller chunks
- **For Better FPS**: Close unnecessary applications
