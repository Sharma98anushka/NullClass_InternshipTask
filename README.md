**Tasks**
1. Visualizing the Colorization Process. Description: Visualize the intermediate stages of your model's colorization process to better understand how the image transitions from grayscale to color. Guidelines: Use visual tools to demonstrate how colorization progresses across your model's layers or stages. GUI is not necessary.

2. Real-time video colorization Description: Create a model for colorizing grayscale video frames in real time. The model should be able to process video streams and live webcam feeds. Guidelines: This job assesses your ability to interpret real-time data and apply colorization techniques efficiently. A graphical user interface (GUI) should be given to display colorized video in real time and allow users to switch between colorization models.

3. Conditional image Colorization Description: Create a model that colorizes grayscale photos based on user-defined circumstances, such as making the sky blue or the grass green. Guidelines: The challenge assesses your ability to incorporate user feedback into the colorization process. The model should allow users to enter or pick color criteria for specific areas of the image. A user interface (GUI) should be implemented to support this interaction

4. Interactive User-Guided Colorization Description: Create a model that allows users to interactively control the colorization process. Users should be able to select specific sections of an image and define the colors they want, which the model will subsequently use to impact the overall colorization of the image. Guidelines: The GUI should allow users to upload photographs, select locations, and set color preferences. The model should dynamically change the colorization based on user input, resulting in a highly personalized colorization experience.

5. Real-time Multi-Object Colorization with Semantic Segmentation Description: In this challenge, you will create a model that colorizes several objects in real time using semantic segmentation. The model should be able to distinguish between different items (such as vehicles, trees, and buildings) and colorize each object using predetermined color schemes. Guidelines: You should design a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to pick and upload real-time video streams while viewing the colorized output. The model should process the video in real-time, reliably detecting and colorizing several objects concurrently.
